# BASTA! Mainz 2021

Code samples for my presentations for [BASTA! Hybrid in Mainz and online](https://basta.net/mainz/)

* C# 9 and 10 - what's cool?
* Asynchronous streaming

## C# 9 and 10 - What's cool?

Nullable reference types and their enhancements from C# 8 to 9 to 10 and top-level statements with C# 9 with enhancements with C# 10 such as *global using directive*, *file-scoped namespaces* and *implicit usings*.

* Minimal Web (ASP.NET Core Empty)
* Minimal API Sample (Weather Forecast injected into a minimal API)

* Records
* Records with EF Core

Source code generators

* Simple Source Generator
* JSON Serializer

Asynchronous streams - `IAsyncEnumerable`, `IAsyncEnumerator`, extensions to the `yield` and `foreach` statements and implementations for async streams with different libraries

* Enumerable
* Async Enumerable
